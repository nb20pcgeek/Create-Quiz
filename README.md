# Create-Quiz
# Written by Neva Buttrey February 22nd-24th weekend of 2019
This program is written in Python for the Discipleship Tutorial.  The program has two pieces:  The database create portion that has a tkinter frontend and a sqlite3 backend database.   The database create portion is used by the teacher or person who is designing a quiz for their students.  The questions and possible answers are keyed into the database using this portion of the program.
The second part of the program is used by the student when they are taking the test. This portion was written prior to my first Python class for the students to have fun sharing questions about a topic they enjoy with their classmates.
